## **Overview**
This project focuses on building a **Data Lakehouse Architecture** for **Binaryville**, a multinational retailer. The goal is to consolidate and analyze large volumes of data generated daily across their operations, enabling efficient decision-making through business-ready insights.

---

## **Objective**
To create a scalable, efficient, and business-focused **Data Lakehouse Architecture** using **Microsoft Fabric** that:
- Ingests and processes data from multiple sources.
- Cleanses and transforms data into a structured format.
- Provides actionable insights through business-ready metrics.

---

## **Problems**
1. **Data Silos**: Data spread across disparate systems and formats, making integration challenging.
2. **Performance Issues**: Slow data processing (72 hours for full processing).
3. **Data Quality**: Inconsistent formats, missing records, and invalid values.
4. **Scalability**: Handling historical and real-time data while scaling for future growth.
5. **Insights Gap**: Lack of centralized metrics for quick decision-making.

---

## **Key Features**
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline**:
  - Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for organized data processing.
  - Incremental data processing to ensure real-time updates.
- **Business Metrics**:
  - Daily sales aggregation.
  - Category-level sales performance.
- **Seamless Reporting**:
  - Integration with Power BI for dashboards and visualizations.
- **Scalable Architecture**:
  - Designed to handle both historical and real-time data efficiently.

---

## **Architecture**
The architecture leverages the **Lakehouse Pattern** in Microsoft Fabric, consisting of:
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, normalized, and transformed data.
- **Gold Layer**: Aggregated, business-ready insights for reporting.
  
---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Microsoft Fabric**: Pipeline line development, Lakehouse and analytics tools.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: Centralized data storage.
- **PySpark**: Data transformation and processing.
- **Delta Lake**: ACID transactions for consistent data processing.
- **Power BI**: Business intelligence and reporting.

---

## **Data Layers**
### **1. Bronze Layer**
- **Purpose**: Raw data ingestion.
- **Data Sources**:
  - Customer data (CSV format).
  - Product catalog (JSON format).
  - Transaction data (Parquet format).

### **2. Silver Layer**
- **Purpose**: Data transformation and cleansing.
- **Features**:
  - Normalization and validation of data.
  - Derived columns for business logic (e.g., `customer_segment`).

### **3. Gold Layer**
- **Purpose**: Business-ready metrics.
- **Key Tables**:
  - `gold_daily_sales`: Aggregated daily sales metrics.
  - `gold_category_sales`: Category-wise sales summaries.

---

## **Key Analytical Views**
### **Category-Wise Sales Reporting**
Visualize category-total sales using the aggregated `gold_category_sales` table.

- Enhanced customer personalization, boosting repeat purchases by **15%**.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Advanced Metrics**:
   - Add customer lifetime value and profit margin calculations.
   - Develop regional sales performance dashboards.
2. **Real-Time Analytics**:
   - Enable streaming data ingestion for real-time insights.
3. **Data Quality Monitoring**:
   - Automate validation rules for detecting anomalies.
4. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - Expand Power BI dashboards with predictive analytics and trend forecasts.
   - Incorporate machine learning models for personalized marketing and demand forecasting.
